# Open Source Contribution Policy, Version 0.3

## Policy

We will accept contributions of good code that we can use from anyone.

## What this means

* "We will accept": This means that we will incorporate your contribution into
  the project's codebase, adapt it as needed, and give you full credit for your
  work.
* "contributions": This means just about anything you wish to contribute to the
  project, as long as it is good code we can use. The easier you make it for us
  to accept your contribution, the happier we are, but if it's good enough, we
  will do a reasonable amount of work to use it.
* "of good code": This means that we will accept contributions that work well
  and efficiently, that fit in with the goals of the project, that match the
  project's coding style, and that do not impose an undue maintenance workload
  on us going forward. This does not mean just program code, either, but
  documentation and artistic works as appropriate to the project.
* "that we can use": This means that your contribution must be given freely and
  irrevocably, that you must have the right to contribute it for our
  unrestricted use, and that your contribution is made under a license that is
  compatible with the license the project has chosen and that permits us to
  include, distribute, and modify your work without restriction.
* "from anyone": This means exactly that. We don't care about anything but your
  code. We don't care about your race, religion, national origin, biological
  gender, perceived gender, sexual orientation, lifestyle, political viewpoint,
  or anything extraneous like that. We will neither reject your contribution nor
  grant it preferential treatment on any basis except the code itself. We do,
  however, reserve the right to tell you to go away if you behave too
  obnoxiously toward us.

## If Your Contribution Is Rejected

If we reject your contribution, it means only that we do not consider it
suitable for our project in the form it was submitted. It is not personal. If
you ask civilly, we will be happy to discuss it with you and help you understand
why it was rejected, and if possible improve it so we can accept it. If we are
not able to reach an agreement, then you are free to fork our project, as with
any Open Source project, and add your contribution to your fork.
